    </article>Hi, I’m Mike. I build websites, teams, and occasionally large strange objects that roll across deserts.

For most of my career I’ve been a cross-functional team builder, helping designers, engineers, strategists, and stakeholders work together like a real unit. Those teams have delivered platforms for organizations like Yale, Stanford, NBC, and The Economist. My work lives mostly in open source land, especially Drupal, but I’m also fluent in WordPress and a handful of JavaScript frameworks. (This site is built with Astro.)

When I’m not making the internet behave, I’m usually making something with my hands. My degree is in Fine Art Printmaking, and I still make prints now and then. I’ve built two Burning Man art cars (one ended up on the cover of an art history textbook, which is still a very funny sentence to say out loud). I’m a woodworker, a furniture builder, and a serial crafter who has absolutely dabbled in crochet and embroidery.

This site is my archive: career work, ideas about building strong teams and better web practices, and a catalog of weird and wonderful things I’ve made over the years.
